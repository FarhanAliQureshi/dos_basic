# DOS QuickBASIC, QBasic, GW-BASIC, and Visual Basic for DOS
I wrote these programs and utilities, when I was a teenager in the 90s, for MS-DOS 5.0 and MS-DOS 6.22 etc. I'll check each program's code, add comments, and maybe refactor it. After testing in FreeDOS or DOSBox, I'll add it here.
* Most of the programs were written for QuickBASIC 4.5. They may run with QBasic.
* If code file contains line numbers then use GW-BASIC.
* If directory contains .MAK file then use Visual Basic for DOS.
