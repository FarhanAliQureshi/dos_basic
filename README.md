# DOS QuickBASIC, QBasic, GW-BASIC, and Visual Basic for DOS
I wrote these programs and utilities, in my tween years in the 90s, for MS-DOS 5.0 and MS-DOS 6.22 etc. I'll check each program's code, add comments, and maybe refactor it. After testing in FreeDOS or DOSBox, I'll add it here.
* Most of the programs were written for QuickBASIC 4.5. They may run with QBasic.
* If code file contains line numbers then use GW-BASIC.
* If directory contains .MAK file then use Visual Basic for DOS.

## Projects
| Project | Interpreter | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [ColorTst](colortst/) | GW-BASIC | Text color test with notes written in comments on how to use text colors and what colors are available. I fixed some glaring spellings and grammatical mistakes, however, I was pleased to read notes from my tween/teen self on how I experimented with values and wrote down the results. |
| [Password](password/) | GW-BASIC | One of my earliest programs that I wrote. Probably, I was in single digit age. I read the IBM BASIC book, cover to cover, and wrote and ran all the snippets and programs written in it. This one was in that book. I still remember that I was blown away with "clever" usage of using black on black color to hide the typed password. After learning about colors, I experimented with colors, and tweaked the program a little bit. |
| [RandOld](randold/) | GW-BASIC | Older version of Random Number Generator. |
| [Random](random/) | GW-BASIC | Newer version of Random Number Generator with colors etc. |
| [CountNum](countnum/) | GW-BASIC | Count numbers up to the given number. Demonstration of FOR LOOP. Program prints number at a specific place on screen. If your computer is quite fast then try 1000 or any other large number. |
| [CommaNum](commanum/) | GW-BASIC | Count numbers up to the given number but display comma as thousand separator. Program prints number at a specific place on screen. If your computer is quite fast then try 1000 or any other large number. |
| [MathTOld](mathtold/) | GW-BASIC | Prints out Math Table between 1 and 20, depending on the choice entered by the user. |
| [MathTbl](mathtbl/) | GW-BASIC | Newer version of Math Table. Neatly prints out Math Table between 1 and 20, depending on user's input. It uses colors and cursor location. It's a spaghetti code with many GOTO statements. |
